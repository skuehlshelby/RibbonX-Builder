# Example Ribbon Using The RibbonX Builder Library
This project creates an example ribbon using the RibbonX-Builder library. All (well, almost all) of ribbon creation code is contained inside the method 'BuildRibbon' in the 'Ribbon' class.
The created ribbon uses a mix of static and dynamic content. It includes custom images for each button that are supplied at runtime. The output looks like this:

<p align="center">
